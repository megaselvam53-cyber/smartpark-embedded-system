🚗 Smart Parking System using Arduino
📌 Project Overview
The Smart Parking System is an embedded system project designed to detect vehicle presence in parking slots and display real-time availability using Arduino.
This system helps reduce manual effort and improves parking efficiency by automatically identifying available and occupied slots.
🎯 Objective
To reduce traffic congestion in parking areas
To automate vehicle entry and exit
To display real-time parking slot availability
To improve parking management efficiency
🔧 Components Used
Arduino Uno
IR Sensors (for slot detection)
Servo Motor (for automatic gate control)
16x2 LCD Display
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Power Supply
⚙️ Working Principle
IR sensors are placed in each parking slot.
When a vehicle occupies a slot, the sensor detects it.
The Arduino processes sensor data.
LCD display shows Available / Occupied slot count.
Servo motor controls the automatic entry/exit gate.
The system updates parking availability in real-time.
