🚗 Smart Parking System using Arduino
📌 Project Overview
The Smart Parking System is an embedded system project designed to detect vehicle presence in parking slots and display real-time availability using Arduino.
This system helps reduce traffic congestion and improves parking efficiency by automatically identifying available and occupied slots.
🎯 Objective
Reduce traffic congestion in parking areas
Automate vehicle entry and exit
Display real-time parking slot availability
Improve parking management efficiency
🔧 Components Used
Arduino Uno
IR Sensors (Slot Detection)
Servo Motor (Gate Control)
16x2 LCD Display
Jumper Wires
Breadboard
Power Supply
⚙️ Working Principle
IR sensors are placed in each parking slot.
When a vehicle occupies a slot, the sensor detects it.
Arduino processes the sensor data.
LCD displays Available / Occupied slot count.
Servo motor controls automatic entry and exit gate.
The system updates parking availability in real-time.
